## Contributing to Scene Specific Messages

I made this module on a whim due to a question in the foundry discord asking if such a module exists. It's a mess, and probably a bad idea to even use. I'm not even sure I will use it. If you will use it, feel free to submit issues, suggestions, or pull requests. 

## Translating

The module should now be fully localized. If you would like to make a translation, please make a PR with `scenemessage/lang/<lang>.json` that has localized keys, referring to `en.json` as your template. I believe partial translations should be fine, as it will default to en in cases where a translation key is lacking. If you are uncomfortable making a PR but want to contribute a translation anyway, contact me on discord or make an issue.
